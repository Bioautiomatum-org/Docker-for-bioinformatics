# Docker for Bioinformatics

## Introduction

Docker is a powerful tool for creating reproducible and scalable bioinformatics environments. This course will teach you how to use Docker to streamline your bioinformatics research.

## Course Overview

The course is divided into four modules:

### Module 1: Introduction to Docker

In this module, you will learn the basics of Docker and containerization. You will learn how to install Docker on your computer, how to create and manage Docker containers, and how to use Docker to package and distribute bioinformatics tools.

### Module 2: Creating Docker Images for Bioinformatics Tools

In this module, you will learn how to create Docker images for bioinformatics tools. You will learn how to write Dockerfiles, how to build Docker images, and how to customize images to meet your specific needs.

### Module 3: Running Bioinformatics Workflows in Docker Containers

In this module, you will learn how to run bioinformatics workflows in Docker containers. You will learn how to use Docker to manage dependencies, how to create workflows with multiple Docker containers, and how to optimize workflows for performance and scalability.

### Module 4: Best Practices for Using Docker in Bioinformatics Research

In this module, you will learn best practices for using Docker in bioinformatics research. You will learn how to manage Docker images and containers, how to collaborate with other researchers using Docker, and how to troubleshoot common issues.

## Course Objectives

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

- Understand the basics of Docker and containerization
- Create Docker images for bioinformatics tools
- Run bioinformatics workflows in Docker containers
- Apply best practices for using Docker in bioinformatics research

## Prerequisites

To take this course, you should have a basic understanding of bioinformatics and the Linux command line. No prior experience with Docker is required.

## Course Materials

All course materials will be provided online. You will need access to a computer with an internet connection to complete the course.

## Instructor

The course will be taught by Dr. Jane Smith, a bioinformatics researcher with over 10 years of experience using Docker in her research. Dr. Smith has published numerous papers on the use of Docker in bioinformatics and is an expert in the field.

## Course Duration

The course is self-paced and can be completed in approximately 4-6 weeks, depending on your schedule.

## Course Fees

The course is free to enroll. However, you will need to pay a fee to take the final exam and receive a certificate of completion.

## Certification

Upon completion of the course, you will be eligible to take a final exam. If you pass the exam, you will receive a certificate of completion from Wellcome Connecting Science.

We hope you enjoy the course and find it valuable for your research!
